# FlowLab

### Interactive Max-Flow Visualizer (Edmonds-Karp Algorithm)

FlowLab is a simple web app for building flow diagrams and watching how a max-flow algorithm works step by step.

## What this app is useful for

- Visualizing how the **Edmonds-Karp** max-flow algorithm moves flow through a network
- Seeing how the **residual graph** changes during each step
- Understanding where a process gets limited by capacity

## Main benefit of these algorithms

Max-flow and min-cut algorithms help you find **bottlenecks** in real processes.  
They show which connections are limiting total throughput, so you can decide where to add capacity or redesign the flow.

## Example process questions you can answer

- Which stage is blocking more work from getting through?
- Which edge or handoff is the bottleneck?
- If I increase one capacity, does total output improve?
